 EMPIRE_DESIGN_ve_kharazi_restorers_desc:0 "Long ago, during the §YAge of Legends§!, the §YAncients§! ruled a vast interstellar empire. This §YRing§! was the seat of their power and wisdom. The §YAncients§! constructed vast galactic wonders and tamed the stars themselves. Then came the §YCollapse§!, a cataclysmic event of galactic proportions that brought a swift end to the §YAge of Legends§!.\n\nOur scholars debate the exact timeline, for there was much chaos, but it has taken over two thousand years for our civilization to recover. Over the millenia we have endured and perservered, constantly striving to restore our former glory. \n\nIn the last decades, our chief technologists have developed the technical expertise to interface directly with the §YRing§!'s maintenance and archival facilities.\n\nWe have restored many of the automated shipyard facilities, and begun launching vessels to examine the extent of the damage to the remainder of the Ring.\n\nNow, we look to the stars and strive to restore the grandeur of the §YAncients§!!"
